# PRWEBSPRING

A web application for borrowing and managing books.

## Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to borrow books from a library and manage their loans. It was developed using Spring Framework , a Java-based framework for building web applications. It uses Spring MVC, a model-view-controller framework for handling HTTP requests and responses, and Spring Integration, a framework for integrating different technologies such as RMI, JaxWS, JaxRS, JMS, and JMX. It also uses Maven as a build tool and Hibernate as an ORM tool.

This project was done  as part of my school project at Centrale Nantes.
